# 🐧 Linux Hacks & Commands

A collection of useful Linux commands and tricks I learned through Hack The Box Academy's Linux Fundamentals module.

## 🔍 File & Directory
- `ls -la` → List all files with details
- `cd ~/Documents/htb` → Navigate to folder
- `find / -name "passwd" 2>/dev/null` → Find sensitive files
- `locate config` → Use locate db to search

## 🔐 Permissions
- `chmod +x script.sh` → Make a script executable
- `chown user:user file.txt` → Change file owner
- `ls -l` → View permission bits

## 🌐 Networking
- `ifconfig` / `ip a` → View IP addresses
- `netdiscover` → Scan LAN for active devices
- `ping`, `traceroute`, `nmap` → Test connectivity and ports
