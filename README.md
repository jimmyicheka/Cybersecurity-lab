# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Labs

Welcome! I'm Jim, a cybersecurity enthusiast passionate about Linux, ethical hacking, and real-world security challenges. This repository documents my learning journey, projects, and writeups from platforms like Hack The Box, OverTheWire, and more.

## 🚀 Goals
- Master Linux fundamentals and system administration
- Solve CTFs and labs from Hack The Box and OverTheWire
- Document writeups and lessons from each lab
- Build and document hacking tools and automation scripts  
- Continuously grow into a professional cybersecurity role  

## 📁 Folder Structure
/linux-fundamentals.md → Tips, command usage & tricks  
/htb-writeups/ → Hack The Box walkthroughs  
/overthewire/ → Bandit and other CTF levels  
/tools/ → Hacking tools


## 🧰 Python Hacking Tools

This section showcases practical cybersecurity tools built in Python by me — each one focuses on automating or demonstrating a core security concept like network spoofing, scanning, or encryption.

📂 **Folder:** [`/tools`](./tools)

### Featured Tools
- **mac_changer** → Educational MAC address changer for Linux interfaces
- *(More tools coming soon — network scanner, port sniffer, and encryption utilities)*

Each tool is self-contained with its own README and usage guide. All are built for learning and ethical hacking practice only.


Stay tuned for regular updates as I learn, break, and build my way into the cybersecurity field 💻🔒
